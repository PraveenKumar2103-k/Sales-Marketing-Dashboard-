## 📈 Business Scenario

The dataset simulates sales and marketing performance for a company with:

- Multi-regional sales data
- Customer demographics
- Campaign costs and conversions

I built this dashboard to analyze patterns, compare performance by region, and understand which campaigns bring the best ROI.

##  Outcome

Through this project, I gained **hands-on experience** with real-world data analysis tools and workflows used by data analysts. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

- ✅ Used **SQL** to clean raw data before importing:
  - Removed nulls, filtered rows
  - Formatted dates correctly using SQL functions
  - Standardized inconsistent values (e.g., regions, product names)
  - Joined multiple datasets (Sales + Customers) for enriched insights

- ✅ In **Power BI**, used **Power Query** to:
  - Ensure proper data types (e.g., Date, Decimal, Whole Number)
  - Rename columns for readability
  - Create new columns like `Month` for time-based analysis

- ✅ Built a well-structured **data model** with relationships across:
  - `Sales`, `Customers`, and `Marketing` tables

- ✅ Wrote custom **DAX Calculated Columns**, including:
  - `ROI = (Conversions * 50) - Cost` for evaluating marketing campaign performance

- ✅ Designed an **interactive dashboard** with:
  - Filters and slicers by Region, Product, and Age Group
  - Multiple visuals (bar, line, pie, column, table)
  - A clean, user-friendly layout optimized for business storytelling

Overall, this project improved my understanding of:
- Data cleaning (SQL + Power Query)
- Relationship modeling
- Business metrics
- Storytelling through data
